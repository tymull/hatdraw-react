# Hatdraw

A website where you can draw names from a hat in either raffle format or gift exchange format. I started it years ago and never got around to finishing it but might someday. I had written the code for the exchange hat to use for a family gift exchange in C++ for fun on an old computer and have included that in the folder Project1, but I have yet to rewrite it for this site. The raffle hat works, but I indend to eventually support saving lists, results, constraints, uploading lists, and more when I get around to it, as well as improve the design a bit. Meanwhile, check out the Raffle Hat!
