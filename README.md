# Hatdraw

A website where you can draw names from a hat in either raffle format or gift exchange format. I started it years ago and never got around to finishing it but might someday. I had originally written the code for the exchange hat to use for a family gift exchange in C++ for fun on an old computer and have included that in the folder Project1 for kicks. I indend to eventually support saving lists, results, drawing one raffle name at a time, uploading lists, and perhaps more when I get around to it, as well as improve the design a bit.
